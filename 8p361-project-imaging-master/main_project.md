# Main project work

Your main project task is to **develop a deep neural network model that can 
identify metastases in image patches from histological preparations of 
lymph node tissue from breast cancer patients**. 

You have to evaluate your model by participating in an open challenge 
competition where the results will be compared to models developed 
by other researchers. 

The developed method and results from the evaluation should be described
in a 4-6 page project report. The audience should be your fellow biomedical engineers. 

The report should use the IEEE template available 
[here](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 
The 6 page limit is strict, however, additional information can be provided in an appendix.
In addition to the project report, you have to deliver code that can be used to fully reproduce the results described
in the report. 

**The project work is open-ended.** This means that you are free to choose
which specific methodology you are going to implement.

The [four assignments](assignments/) serve as an introduction to the
project topic, dataset challenge competition where you have to submit
results for evaluation. In addition, [assignment 3](assignments/cnn.ipynb), provides a minimal
working example that can be used as a starting point for the main project
work. 

**The project work will be assessed based based on the assessment rubric provided
[here](rubric.md).**
