Furthermore, you get to work with the PatchCAMELYON (or PCAM) dataset that you should also use for the main project work. Essentially, this assignment demonstrated a minimal working example for the main project work.\n",

As before, we will go over the components of the code in this Python notebook, however, you are strongly encouraged to perform all experiments using `cnn.py`. We start with importing the required libraries and defining the size of the images in the PCAM dataset.\n"

This is why, we need to define some functions that will read the image data batch by batch, so only a single batch of images needs to be stored in memory at one time point. We can use the handy ImageDataGenerator function from the Keras API to do this. Note that the generators are defined within a function that returns them as output arguments. This function will later be called from the main code body. \n"

Organizing the code into functions instead of piling everything up in a single script makes the code more clear to read and understand, and helps reuse functionality that is already implemented. For example, we can use the `get_pcam_generators()` function to create data generators with different batch sizes just by calling the function with a different set of parameters. Or, we can use the `get_model()` function to generate networks with different number of feature maps (see below). \n",

The kernel size and number of filters of the two convolutional layers, and the size of the max pooling regions can be passed as input parameters to the function (however, note that default values are set so the function can be called without parameters). ReLU nonlinearities are used throughout the network, except for the output neuron that is activated with a sigmoid. "

To compare different classifiers, i.e. the same classifier with different learning parameters or completely different classifiers, the ROC curve can be useful [boek]. A single run of one classifier gives a single point on the ROC plot [boek].* \n",

    "*In medical context for instance, the basic principle of the ROC curve is to quantify how accurately medical diagnostic tests can discriminate between two patient states e.g. diseased or healthy [A]. By altering the decision threshold we will get different fractions of TP and FP [B]. For all these decision thresholds then the fractions are plotted in the ROC curve. A classifier is deemed to be 'perfect' when it is located at the point (0,1) on the ROC curve, i.e. when the classifier has a TPR of 1 and a FPR of 0 for a specific decision threshold. Moreover, when the ROC curve corresponds to the 45 degree line (y = x), the diagnostic test that belongs to this curve is as good as random guessing (i.e. chance level) [A]. In other words, we have a test which yields positive or negative results unrelated to the true disease status [A]. Hence, the closer to the top-left-hand corner the result of a classifier is, the better it has performed [boek]. Thus, to compare different classifiers, one can use the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to evaluate and compare model performance. Since the closer the classifier gets to the 'ideal' point of (0,1), the larger the AUC and the better the classifier performs [boek].*\n",

    "It is possible to construct a neural network model that is equivalent to the model above, however, only using convolutional layers (i.e. without using any fully connected or \"dense\" layers). Construct and train such a model. \n",

    "What would be the advantage of only using convolutional layers?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equivalent? Do they mean using a convolutional neural network with a kernel of 1 ? But what would be the advantage of that? Dense can be replaced by convolutional layer with kernel 1 and then we need to replace max pooling layer by convolutional layer?* \n",

    "\n",
    "*It is possible to construct a neural network model using only convolutional layers. When using multiple convolutional layers, each convolutional layer is assigned their own features to detect. Usually, the first convolutional layer is used for low-level feature detection, e.g. edges, color, gradient orientation etc. [C]. The next layers then combine these features into more complex features to allow for the detection of specific characteristics of an image.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*The architecture of a convolutional neural network, in comparison to an ordinary feed forward neural network, allows for better fitting to the image dataset caused by a reduction in the number of parameters involved and the reusability of weights [C]. Using only convolutional layers drastically reduces the amount of weights that needs to be calculated and updated during back propagation. An advantage is thus that the computation time is decreased and overall the creation of the neural network model is less computationally expensive. In summary, the goal of a convolutional neural network is to reduce the images into a form which allows for easy processing without losing features that are necessary for getting an accurate prediction [C].*\n",
