    "# Assignment 1: Introduction to histopathology image analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to define and analyze the problem that you will be working on. In the main project, you will develop a **deep neural network** model that can identify **metastases** in image patches from histological preparations of lymph node tissue from breast cancer patients. Then, you will submit results of the developed model to an open **challenge** competition where it will be compared to models developed by other researchers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following three subsections give an introduction to deep learning, medical image analysis challenges/competitions, and detection of lymph node metastases. This very brief text along with the provided references are a good starting point for further exploration these topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep learning for medical image analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "In the coming decade, artificial intelligence will affect many aspects of human life and society ranging from home automation and self-driving cars to algorithmic detection of “fake news” on social media. This technology will also inevitably influence healthcare and in turn medical imaging. One of the most active fields of research in artificial intelligence is deep machine learning [1][2]. This concept works by learning abstract, hierarchical feature representations of input data that are predictive of a certain target (e.g. a class label in the case of classification). In contrast to classical machine learning methods, deep learning eliminates the step of “manual” feature engineering that is a tedious process and sub-optimal compared with learned representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of medical image analysis, the use of deep learning methods has already resulted in notable progress for a variety of tasks. Some of the first applications where automatic methods were shown to outperform medical experts have been in histopathology image analysis [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Medical image analysis challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the developments that brought about the success of deep learning methods in computer vision was the availability of large, public annotated image datasets. In medical image analysis, this was mirrored in the form of medical image analysis challenges – friendly competitions in which researchers worldwide evaluate their solutions on the same data with the same criteria, in a blinded manner [4]. Organizing a challenge constitutes collecting and publicly distributing a training dataset that can be used to address a specific clinical task (such as detection of lymph node metastases). The ground truth for the testing is set is retained by the organizers of the challenge, which facilitates fair and independent evaluation and comparison of methods. The organization of medical image analysis challenges has had a tremendous impact on the advancement of the state of the art in the field. In the coming decade, such efforts will continue to push the field forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the main project work, you will use a dataset of image patches [9] derived from the CAMELYON16 challenge [3]. This Patch-CAMELYON dataset is itself published as a challenge on the Kaggle platform [10], where you will submit the results of your project work for independent evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some other examples of histopathology image analysis challenges organized by our group are AMIDA13 [5] and TUPAC16 [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detection of lymph node metastases\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of metastases in sentinel axillary lymph nodes is an important component of breast cancer staging [7]. This is evaluated by examination of histological preparations of lymph node tissue by pathologists. The figure below gives an example of a metastasis in lymph node tissue. Although manual assessment by a pathologists is the current standard practice, this procedure is notoriously tedious to perform and can result in missed metastases, which in turn results in suboptimal therapy planning for the patients. The move towards digitalization of histopathology labs with the introduction of whole-slide image scanners [8], has opened the possibility of automating some of the tasks performed by pathologists with the use of image analysis methods. The goal is to have faster, more accurate and more objective analysis of the tissue. Tedious and error prone tasks such as detection of metastases are a very good use case for introduction of automated image analysis.\n",

    "### Setting up the working environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you are free to use a programming language and environment of your own choice for the main project work, the examples in the assignments are in Python. If you need to refresh your Python programming skills, we recommend the following educational modules that we have prepared: https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with setting up a Python environment, follow the instructions in the Getting Started section of the [Essential Skills](https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills/blob/master/python-essentials.md) Python module. The Anaconda distribution is recommended. Optionally, you can use the desktop GUI called Anaconda Navigator.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the complete development environment for this course, you need to install seven additional Python packages: `matplotlib`, `jupyter`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `spyder`, `pandas`, and `tensorflow`. It is recommended to install these packages in a separate Conda environment. A Conda environment is a directory in which you can install files and packages such that their dependencies will not interact with other environments, which is very useful if you develop code for different courses or research projects. If you want to know more about how to use Conda, read the [docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Anaconda, you can create a new Conda environment and install the required packages by running the following commands from the Anaconda Prompt application (without the comments):\n",
    "\n",
    "````bash\n",
    "conda create --name 8p361 python=3.8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t # create a new environment called `8p361`\n",
    "conda activate 8p361\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t # activate this environment \n",
    "conda install matplotlib jupyter scikit-learn scipy spyder pandas    # install the required packages\n",
    "pip install tensorflow\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   # install tensorflow seperately through pip\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: You have to activate the `8p361` environment every time you start working on the assignments (`conda activate 8p361`).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### OPTIONAL installation instructions for GPU-support in tensorflow:\n",
    "By default, Tensorflow will train the neural networks on the CPU. Training on the CPU is slower than training the neural networks on the GPU. If you want to accelerate your training, these additional advanced steps will allow the neural network to be trained on the GPU, which could save time during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install CUDA Toolkit 11.0 https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.0-download-archive, other versions will not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download cuDNN 8.0.4 for CUDA 11.0  https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive, other versions will not work. This requires the creation of an account and logging in. To expedite the process you can use a Google account.\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading, Put the cuda folder inside the downloaded cuDNN zip file in the following location: `C:\\tools\\`. If this folder does not exist, create it.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT NOTE: After installing CUDA Toolkit 11.0 you MUST navigate to `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.0\\extras\\CUPTI\\lib64`, copy the file `cupti64_2020.1.0.dll`, and rename its copy to `cupti64_110.dll`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, assuming you installed everything in the default locations, you must add some folders to your path variable by searching for `Edit the system environment variables`, clicking `Environment Variables` in the menu that pops up. Select `Path` in the `System variables` box and click `Edit`.\n",
    "Once in this menu, ensure that `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.0\\bin`, `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.0\\extras\\CUPTI\\lib64`, `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.0\\include`, and `C:\\tools\\cuda\\bin` are added to the path. If not already there, click the 'New' button and add all missing paths in seperate fields.\n",

    "In the exercises below you have to answer some questions relating to topic of the project work. The answers to the questions can be found in the literature list above, however, you are strongly encouraged to expand this list by performing a literature search yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the clinical utility of evaluating the presence of metastases in sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients? In other words, how is this information used in the clinical decision making process for breast cancer patients?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer: Detecting metastases is an important component of surgical managment of breast cancer [A]. It determines the next treatment steps for the patients. If metastases are detected in sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer patients, doctors know that the cancer has spread further and may want to do surgery to  remove the metastases to prevent the cancer from spreading to vital organs. If there is no intervention, the cancer can easily spread further from the lymph nodes to other parts in the body with desastrous consequences for the patient.*\n",

    "## Exercise 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "How does the introduction of whole-slide imaging change the typical workflow of a pathology lab?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer: The whole-slide imaging technique was the first step towards automation and digitization of analysis tasks previously done by pathologists[C]. Digitization of metastase analysis allows for less error prone computer assessment rather than humane assessment. It also allows for telepathology, enabling remote interpretation of tissue samples. Over time the technique has had major developments in its usability. Nowadays, WSI is generally approved for primary diagnosis[D]. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence will lead to the normalization of computational pathology and inevitably the amelioration of diagnosic accuracy and precision[E]. *   \n",

    "The PatchCamelyon dataset is derived from the CAMELYON16 dataset of whole-slide images. Describe how a neural network classification model trained on small image patches can be applied to larger, whole-slide images with the goal of detecting metastases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer: NNC models often consist of multiple layers of parameters (or neurons) which are trained by being fed data[F]. By feeding a model many instances of normal and metastases images this network 'learns' the ability to recognize metastases. Detection of certain visual characteristics is then initiated by applying the model to large WSI images.      \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer: In general, the tissue of the metastases appears to be more dense. It seems that there are more blood vessels present, which is necessary for the increased supply of nutrients for the cancerous cells and less open spaces in comparison to the normal tissue. The cell nuclei in the metastases appear bigger and are surrounded by a smaller cytoplasm in comparison to normal cell nuclei. This makes sense since larger nuclei are often associated with cancerous cells [B]. Due to the quick cell division of cancerous cells, the cytoplasm is given less time to grow which accounts for the large cell nucleus and relatively small cytoplasm in the cells of the metastases. Besides the size of the nuclei of the cancerous cells, the shape also differs from normal cells. The normal cells have round, symmetrical smooth nuclei whereas the tumor cells contain nuclei with irregular shapes.* \n",
